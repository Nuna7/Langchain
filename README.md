# Video Knowledge Tester: Question Generation using FLAN-T5-XXL and LangChain

This project builds a question-generation system using the `flan-t5-xxl` model via HuggingFace. The core logic leverages LangChain's `LLMChain` to incorporate the transcript into a pre-designed prompt for generating context-aware questions. Given a video transcript, the system generates questions to test whether the user comprehends the material.
